# How to setup

Pretty much every file in this repo is useless except the `main.py`, which obviously is the script you'll want to run, and the `demo.mp4` which explains stuff better than this README.md

The script works for me but might not work for you as is, it's poor quality but does the job.

=> However, if you still want to try it out, you can just download the file and run it. You'll need to install the libraries using the `pip install <library>` command in a terminal.

# How to customize

If you want to replace the icons I use (because I use my personal logo in them lol), you can create a new application on the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and replace the ID / assets, as shown in the demo.mp4 video file.

Honestly just watch the demo.mp4, and if you have an issue, contact me on Discord: @misudashi.

# Useless commentary

I use a `spotify-rpc.bat` thing on my desktop so it's easier and I don't have to use the command line every time. 

It just goes :

```batch

cd C:\Users\codee\Desktop\Spotify Discord RPC
color b
python main.py

```

Obviously you'll want to change the path and you should be good.

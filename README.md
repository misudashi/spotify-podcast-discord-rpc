# How to setup

The script works for me but might not work for you as is, it's poor quality but does the job.

=> However, if you still want to try it out, you can just download the file and run it. You'll need to install the libraries using the `pip install <library>` command in a terminal.

# How to customize

If you want to replace the icons I use (because I use my personal logo in them lol), you can create a new application on the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and replace the ID / assets, as shown in the demo.mp4 video file.

Honestly just watch the demo.mp4, and if you have an issue, contact me on Discord: @misudashi.
